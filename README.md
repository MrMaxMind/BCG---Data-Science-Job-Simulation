# BCG - Data Science Job Simulation Program

Welcome to my submissions for the **BCG Open-Access Data Science Advanced Analytics Virtual Experience Program**. This program consists of four modules designed to simulate real-world business scenarios using data-driven methods to provide insights and recommendations.

---

## 🚀 Program Modules

The program consists of 4 modules:

1. **Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
3. **Feature Engineering & Modelling**
4. **Findings & Recommendations**

Each module focuses on a different aspect of the data science process, leading up to actionable insights for a client case study.

## Task 1 - Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing

### 🎯 Objective:
Understanding the business context and problem statement to formulate a hypothesis for customer churn.

### 📝 Task Overview:
PowerCo, a major energy utility company, faces significant churn in its SME (Small & Medium Enterprise) segment due to market liberalization. The hypothesis suggests that **price sensitivity** drives customer churn, and we aim to develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk.

### 🔍 Key Questions:
- How does price affect customer churn?
- What other factors influence a customer's decision to churn or stay?

### 💡 Deliverable:
Formulate the hypothesis and outline the key steps required to test this hypothesis. Identify the data required and suggest analytical models to test it.

## Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis

### 🎯 Objective:
Understand the business problem through data and verify the hypothesis of **price sensitivity** influencing customer churn.

### 📝 Task Overview:
The team received data including customer information, historical usage, pricing, and churn indicators. The goal is to explore and visualize the data to understand key patterns, distributions, and relationships.

### 🔍 Key Steps:
1. **Sub-Task 1:** Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get a holistic understanding of the dataset.
2. **Sub-Task 2:** Investigate whether price sensitivity correlates with churn.
3. **Sub-Task 3:** Summarize key findings and suggest potential data augmentation sources.

### 💡 Insights:
- **Price Sensitivity:** Initial findings suggest a correlation between price changes and customer churn.
- **Further Exploration:** Suggest adding external data sources, such as economic indicators or customer satisfaction surveys, to refine the analysis.

## Task 3 - Feature Engineering & Modelling

### 🎯 Objective:
Develop features from the dataset and train a **Random Forest** model to predict customer churn.

### 📝 Task Overview:
Feature engineering is essential for uncovering signals in the data. The goal is to build features that capture customer behavior and price sensitivity and use these features to build a predictive churn model.

### 🔍 Key Steps:
1. **Sub-Task 1:** Engineer features from the cleaned dataset, focusing on variables like pricing changes, customer usage patterns, and time-based features.
2. **Sub-Task 2:** Train a **Random Forest classifier** to predict churn probability and evaluate the model performance.

### 📊 Data Visualizations:
- **Model Performance:** Accuracy, precision, and recall were used to evaluate the model's effectiveness.

### 💡 Model Insights:
- **Feature Importance:** Features related to price sensitivity and customer usage had the most predictive power.
- **Model Performance:** The model performed well, with accuracy and recall showing satisfactory results.

## Task 4 - Findings & Recommendations

### 🎯 Objective:
Summarize findings and provide recommendations based on the predictive model for customer churn.

### 📝 Task Overview:
The goal of this task is to deliver an **executive summary** of the findings, focusing on how the model can help reduce churn by identifying at-risk customers and offering targeted discounts.

### 💡 Deliverable:
Prepare an abstract slide for the client, presenting key findings, model performance, and actionable recommendations.

## 🚀 Key Takeaways:
- **Targeted Discounts:** Offering a 20% discount to high-risk customers based on the churn model could significantly reduce churn rates.
- **Predictive Power:** The model’s ability to predict at-risk customers was strong, allowing for effective intervention strategies.
- **Business Impact:** The financial impact of reducing churn is substantial, as retaining SME customers has a direct effect on long-term profitability.
